This is a simple app to show the responsiveness of node.js/socket.io

Feel free to poke around the code, there isn't much of it.

To play the game:
    Enter your name and wait for other people to join
    Click on the other names to steal their points

This game requires:
    node.js
    express.js
    socket.io

I am using jQuery on the front end.
